# Parts of the app

## Example breakout of sprints

### Initial Planning (Day 1, morning)

#### Decide on an idea. For realz.

#### Whiteboard an MVP

### Exploring libraries (and/or third party data sources) (Day 1, afternoon)

- spend no more than 20-30 minutes on a "spike"
    - up to 4 spikes for a single major feature
    - a spike means: can i get it to work at all, referencing their example code
- find a _good_ library
    - should support at least Node.js version 8 (pref 9)
    - hopefully updated in the last 8-10 months
    - docs have examples that you can follow
        - i.e., bad examples require you to install a dozen other node modules
    

### Start coding! (Day 2, morning)

#### Create interfaces

##### Backend Dev & Database Dev create dummy JSON to work from

- Decide what the data models are going to return from static and instance methods
- save those examples in files.


#### Front-end Dev & Backend Dev create dummy (JSON) to work from

- Decide what data will appear on which pages (that is, which routes)
- save those examples in files.

##### And how will we use that JSON data?

- If someone is behind, you can always write a function that returns that JSON data.

### Daily Merge & Demo (afternoon or morning)

- What is working?
- What can we mark as _done_ on the trello board?
- Who is blocked?
- How can I help?
- What are we working on next?
